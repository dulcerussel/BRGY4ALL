# BRGY4ALL

BRGY4ALL Platform consists of two parts: The Web application which is purely for Public Servants and Mobile App for Public Servants and the Citizens. The Web app would act as a QR code generator, announcement maker, database admin, and survey form where the barangay officials use this to fill out the forms given the information by each citizen and it should be true and complete. A form is a specialized form that has a broad scope of needed information which can be viewed in their Database and help them in extracting and dividing to their specialized needs: like citizens who need financial help, who are with Senior Citizens and PWDs, who is pregnant or has a baby that needs a vaccine, who needs jobs and etc. after the form is filled, the Web app generates a QR code that the citizens can scan this code and register to their mobile version app and can be printed to those who don’t have smartphone/cell phones.
The Mobile application can be used for Public Servants and Citizens: Public Servants will use this mobile app whether they are distributing aids (Ayudas) face-to-face to their citizens to help them check their addresses, update their database by scanning the citizens owned QR code and take a photo to the citizens who are just received their aid which helps them to be more documented. The Citizens, on the other hand, notify whether there’s an event in the barangay, announcements like the “Ayudas” or Free Medical Check-ups are coming or you are qualified to be in this kind of service or aid and when they meet their Public Servants from distributing their needed aids, all they need is to share their own QR code and let them scan it; take them a photo of themselves from the Public servants and take some additional forms if there are unique information needed.
